# "Elite Matrix" editor colors for PhpStorm

A PhpStorm editor color theme inspired by the game Elite, the movie Matrix and colors taken/inspired from (G)VIM.

Certainly not yet finished, but should work for most things. Cases like added/deleted lines are not yet covered (i.e. haven't received much thought yet).
