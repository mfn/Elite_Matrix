# "Elite Matrix" editor colors for PhpStorm

A PhpStorm editor color theme inspired by the game Elite (background color), the movie Matrix (font color) and colors taken/inspired from (G)VIM dark background colors.

Certainly not yet finished, but should work for most things. Cases like added/deleted lines are not yet covered (i.e. haven't received much thought yet).

## Fits well with the Darcula theme
